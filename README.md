# group-project-2
This project is an extention of our Group Project 1 about the Sacramento Kings basketball team. In this project we utilized more html & css as well as JS. We created a store front to sell some jerseys of the team throughout their history. We used did both frontend and backend coding. Our storefront has thumbnail images for each item, a shopping cart where users can add and remove items, a mock checkout page, a user profile with the ability to login/logout and a functional navbar to get around our store. This was a challenging project but in the end it was extremly rewarding having a vague idea of a store and creating something that looks pretty legit!
